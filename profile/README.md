# BOOKSITOUT
- a small business that makes `website` / `app` to make people live more convient life.
- I work as a `backend engineer` at largest Fintech Company in South Korea called [Toss](https://toss.im), and doing this as a side project to gain more experiences and perhaps earn some extra bucks.
- I don't like to claim that I want to make the world a better place because I can't, but at least I am trying to make products that have positive impacts on people's lives.
